Explanation

Understanding the problem
The error message [useWebSocketVoice] WebSocket closed before connection could be established. indicates that your application attempted to use a WebSocket connection, but the connection was closed before the initial handshake was completed. This means the client tried to open the connection, but the server either rejected it immediately or the connection was dropped before it was fully set up.

How to verify
To verify this, you can:

Check the Network tab in DevTools: Look for WebSocket connections. You should see one that attempted to connect but shows a failed status (e.g., 1006 abnormal closure).
Examine server logs: If you have access to the server, check the logs for any errors or rejections related to WebSocket connection attempts at the time this error occurs in the browser.
Suggested fix
This error typically happens due to network issues, server-side configuration problems, or incorrect WebSocket URL/protocol. Here are some potential fixes:

Verify the WebSocket URL: Ensure the URL you are trying to connect to is correct and accessible from the client's network.
Check server-side WebSocket implementation: Make sure your server is properly configured to handle WebSocket connections on the specified endpoint. This includes ensuring the server is running and listening for WebSocket requests.
Review network connectivity: Rule out local network issues on the client's side that might be preventing the connection.
Inspect server-side errors: If the server is rejecting the connection, the server logs should provide more specific reasons (e.g., authentication failure, invalid protocol).
Without seeing the code that initiates the WebSocket connection, it's hard to provide a more specific code fix. However, the issue lies in the process of establishing the connection itself, not in the intercept-console-error.js file shown in your provided code snippet, which is merely logging the error. You need to debug the code that calls useWebSocketVoice and attempts to connect.

Summary
The error "WebSocket closed before connection could be established" means the initial attempt to connect to a WebSocket server failed. This is usually due to issues with the server's availability, incorrect WebSocket URL, or network problems. Debug by checking network requests, server logs, and the code initiating the WebSocket connection.
