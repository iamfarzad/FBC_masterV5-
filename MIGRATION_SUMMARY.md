# AI SDK Migration Summary

## Executive summary
`feature/ai-sdk-backend-hardening` now delivers a full AI SDK integration across customer chat and the admin assistant. The AI Elements conversation shell stays in place, but the runtime can switch between the original pipeline, a native AI SDK implementation, or a simple fallback via feature flags. `/api/chat/unified` powers the primary flow with streaming metadata, while `/api/chat/simple` backs the non-streaming option. Documentation reflects the shipped behaviour instead of speculative plans.

## Delivered
- AI Elements (and the optional Native AI SDK view) render every transcript with suggestions, tool/task scaffolding, and streaming loaders.
- `/api/chat/unified` streams Gemini output, enriches completions with reasoning/tasks/citations, and forwards tool invocation data, while `/api/chat/simple` offers a generateText fallback.
- `useUnifiedChat`, `useSimpleAISDK`, `useNativeAISDK`, and the global store variant expose the same contract and sync into `src/core/chat/state/unified-chat-store.ts` for selector hooks and devtools.
- Feature flags in `src/core/feature-flags/ai-sdk-migration.ts` decide whether native AI SDK features, enhanced metadata, or legacy fallbacks run for a session/user/admin.
- Multimodal widgets, stage sync, and control panels continue to push updates through the shared actions context so transcripts remain aligned with intelligence data.

## Outstanding
- `useUnifiedChat` still logs TODOs for regenerate/resume/tool-result handlers, and the native hook's reload/stop helpers are stubs.
- Automated coverage is missing for the SSE pipeline, tool metadata mapping, and feature-flag routing paths.
- Chat Devtools provides a lightweight overlay, but deeper performance telemetry and rollout monitoring remain future work.
- Long-running auxiliary tool flows (uploads, ROI, etc.) could surface richer progress/error metadata through the unified stream.

## Recommended next steps
1. Implement regenerate/resume flows end-to-end so stalled streams recover without manual refreshes.
2. Add automated tests for SSE chunking, metadata extraction, and feature-flag selection logic.
3. Expand devtools/telemetry to monitor rollout health and surface performance metrics.
4. Tighten auxiliary tool integrations so progress/errors reach the conversation metadata channel in real time.
