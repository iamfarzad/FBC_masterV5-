# Frontend Design System & Style Guide

All UI and frontend code must strictly follow the canonical design system and style guide as defined in [frontend_design.md](mdc:frontend_design.md).

**Key requirements:**
- Use only design tokens for color, spacing, typography, border radius, and shadows as defined in [frontend_design.md](mdc:frontend_design.md) and [DESIGN.md](mdc:DESIGN.md).
- Reference all color and font variables via CSS custom properties or Tailwind config. No hard-coded hex/rgb values or inline font-family in components.
- Use Tailwind's spacing and border radius scale mapped to tokens.
- Follow the accessibility, responsive, and ARIA guidelines in [frontend_design.md](mdc:frontend_design.md).
- All interactive elements must have visible focus states using the accent color.
- Use only approved component patterns (e.g., .btn-primary, .card-minimal, etc.) and avoid arbitrary values in Tailwind classes.
- All changes to design tokens or style rules require UI owner approval as per [DESIGN.md](mdc:DESIGN.md).

**References:**
- [frontend_design.md](mdc:frontend_design.md) (canonical design system)
- [DESIGN.md](mdc:DESIGN.md) (token source, change policy)
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

**Violations:**
- No inline styles for color, font, or spacing
- No hard-coded hex/rgb values in components
- No arbitrary values in Tailwind classes (e.g., `text-[#ff5b04]`)
- No direct font-family in component files

All PRs must pass style lint and visual regression tests. For any questions, consult the design system documentation or UI owner.
