# Backend Architecture Reference

For all backend-related tasks, design, and code changes, always follow the architecture, conventions, and best practices described in [backend_architecture.md](mdc:backend_architecture.md).

- This includes API design, data models, error handling, security, scalability, and deployment.
- Any deviation from the documented architecture must be justified and documented.
- Use [backend_architecture.md](mdc:backend_architecture.md) as the single source of truth for backend system structure and policies.
