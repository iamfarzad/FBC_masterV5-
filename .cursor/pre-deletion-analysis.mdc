# Pre-Deletion Analysis Requirement

**When deleting or refactoring any file**, Cursor AI must:

1. **Show where each deleted symbol is used**  
   - Run a dependency scan (e.g. `grep -R 'filename' .`) and list all import sites.
2. **Map old functionality to new code**  
   - For every deleted function/class, include a code snippet of its replacement or migration in the new file.
3. **Include a summary table**  
   - A 2-column markdown table: Deleted File → Kept/Replaced In.
4. **Run CI checks**  
   - Simulate an import/build step to prove no missing-module errors.
5. **Require sign-off**  
   - Only allow the deletion if all usages are covered and tests still pass.

**Rejection criteria:**  
- Any deletion without the above analysis block.  
- Any missing mapping for a deleted symbol.  
- Any build-or-import failures after the change.

With this in place, Cursor AI can no longer nuke files without first showing you exactly how it's preserving or replacing their behavior. That should stop the "rules → chaos" cycle.
