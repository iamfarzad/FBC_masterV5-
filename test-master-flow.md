# 🔧 MASTER FLOW: End-to-End Test Plan

## ✅ Master Flow Implementation Complete

### **Changes Made:**

1. **✅ Consent → Session-Init Wiring**
   - `app/api/consent/route.ts`: Now calls `/api/intelligence/session-init` after consent
   - Passes `sessionId` to trigger intelligence initialization
   - Returns `intelligenceReady: true` when successful

2. **✅ Chat Page Intelligence Integration**
   - `app/(chat)/chat/page.tsx`: Fixed intelligence context loading
   - Renamed `context` → `intelligenceContext` for clarity
   - Added loading indicator for intelligence processing
   - Fixed `useUnifiedChat` integration with intelligence context

3. **✅ Unified Provider Intelligence Support**
   - `src/core/chat/unified-provider.ts`: Enhanced intelligence context processing
   - Structured intelligence data for system prompts
   - Added server-side safety net to lazy-load context

4. **✅ Session-Init Idempotency**
   - `app/api/intelligence/session-init/route.ts`: Proper context structure returned
   - Consistent `context` key for frontend consumption

5. **✅ StageRail Intelligence Connection**
   - `components/collab/StageRail.tsx`: Connected to intelligence stages
   - Real-time stage calculation based on intelligence progress

6. **✅ PDF Pipeline Intelligence Integration**
   - `app/api/export-summary/route.ts`: Uses intelligence context for PDF generation
   - Fallback to legacy sources if intelligence unavailable

7. **✅ Type Consolidation**
   - Merged 4 duplicate `intelligence.ts` files into single source
   - Removed type conflicts and circular dependencies
   - Updated all imports to use consolidated types

8. **✅ Duplicate File Cleanup**
   - Removed `types/intelligence.ts` (duplicate)
   - Removed `src/core/intelligence.ts` (duplicate)
   - Consolidated imports to use `@/src/core/types`

## 🎯 Test Flow (Manual Verification)

### **Expected Behavior:**

1. **Consent Submission**
   ```
   User fills form → POST /api/consent → POST /api/intelligence/session-init → Intelligence research starts
   ```

2. **Chat Page Load**
   ```
   Page loads → GET /api/intelligence/context → Intelligence context loaded → Personalized AI responses
   ```

3. **AI Responses**
   ```
   User messages → Unified Chat → Intelligence-enhanced system prompts → Personalized responses with company/role context
   ```

4. **Stage Progress**
   ```
   StageRail → Shows current stage based on intelligence progress → Updates in real-time
   ```

5. **PDF Generation**
   ```
   "Share Summary" → Uses intelligence context → Generates PDF with research data → Download/Email works
   ```

## 🧪 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# 1. Start the development server
cd /workspace && pnpm dev

# 2. Open the chat page
open http://localhost:3000/chat

# 3. Test the flow:
#    - Fill consent form with real email
#    - Check browser console for "Intelligence initialized"
#    - Check for "Intelligence context loaded" 
#    - Ask "who are you?" - should mention your company/role
#    - Check StageRail shows progress
#    - Try "Share Summary" PDF download
```

## 🚨 Key Integration Points Fixed

- **❌ OLD**: Consent had no intelligence connection
- **✅ NEW**: Consent triggers `/api/intelligence/session-init`

- **❌ OLD**: Chat page had empty intelligence context
- **✅ NEW**: Chat page loads and uses intelligence context

- **❌ OLD**: AI responses were generic
- **✅ NEW**: AI responses are personalized with company/role data

- **❌ OLD**: StageRail was disconnected
- **✅ NEW**: StageRail shows intelligence-based progress

- **❌ OLD**: PDF used legacy lead data
- **✅ NEW**: PDF uses intelligence context first, legacy fallback

## 🎉 Master Flow Status: **CONNECTED**

The entire pipeline from TC/consent → intelligence → chat → tools → PDF → email is now one consistent, connected system!
